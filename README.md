User Story 1 - Nav
I am a photograher as i take shots everytime i need to remember what i have done so far n what is left to do , I am a user of many apps, but I have so many tasks and items all over many different applications. I would like a simple interface, task management application. So that I can be sure not to miss any shots , and stay on top of my day.

User Story 3 - Nancy
I am a student, studying RN at Princeton university, I have a lot of books and papers to lug around, and my paper to-do-lists tend to keep getting lost as I move from class to class. I would like an application that allows me to keep track of which classes and homework assignments i need to stay on top of, while also allowing me to be aware of which assignments I've already completed.


Wireframes are also provided in the GitHub repository for this application, as well as quick reference screenshots of the wireframes for ease of access.
**Node modules have been removed to save space, but can easily be reinstalled by terminal command 'npm install' in the source directory.**
